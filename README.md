# C++ Practice Codes
This repository contains my practice codes in C++.  
It includes examples of basic concepts, exercises, and small programs that I wrote while learning and improving my C++ skills.

# Contents
- Basic syntax and input/output
- Variables and data types
- Conditional statements (if, else, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Functions
- Arrays and strings
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, constructors, etc.)
- Other practice problems

# Purpose
The main goal of this repository is:
- To practice writing clean and understandable C++ code
- To keep track of my learning progress
- To share my work with others who are also learning C++
